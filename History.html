            <h1 id="HS">Historical Background of Osogbo</h1> 
       <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Osogbo, also spelled Oshogbo, town, capital of Osun state, southwestern Nigeria.
        Lying along the Osun (Oshun) River, it is situated on the railroad from Lagos and
        at the intersection of roads from Ilesa, Ede, Ogbomosho, and Ikirun.  The town is 
        served by a local airport.
      
        Originally settled by the Ijesha (a subtribe of the Yoruba) from Ibokun, 12 miles
        (19 km) east, it remained a small town subservient to the Ijesha kingdom of Ilesa,
        to the southeast, until it was greatly enlarged in the early 19th century by an influx
        of Oyo-Yorubas fleeing from the Fulani conquerors.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1840 Osogbo was the scene of a battle that proved the turning point in the Fulani-
        Yoruba wars. Armed with European rifles bought from coastal tribes, infantrymen from 
        Ibadan decisively defeated the Fulani cavalrymen; this victory made Ibadan, 50 miles 
        (80 km) southwest, the largest and most powerful city of the Yoruba people. Osogbo 
        continued to pay tribute to Ibadan until 1951, when it became part of that province.
        It became part of Oyo state in 1976 and the capital of the newly created state of Osun 
        in 1991.

        The present Yoruba inhabitants of Osogbo have an oba (“king”) who functions in an 
        advisory role holds the traditional title of ataoja (“he who stretches out his hand
        and takes the fish”), first given to Laro, one of the town’s founders, who, according 
        to legend,fed the fish of the Osun River and in return received a liquid believed to be
        effective against sterility in women. The river and its personification and namesake,the 
        goddess Osun (or Oshun; a Yoruba heroine deified for her role in saving Osogbo), are 
        honoured at an annual festival in the town in August. Two chalk- and camwood-covered 
        shrine are connected with this worship—the Ile Osun (at the oba’s market), in which are 
        stored the idols of the cult, and the Ojubo Osun (on a bend of the river at Laro’s original
        settlement), which is the centre of the worship. The Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, a forested 
        area with shrines and sanctuaries honouring Osun and other deities, was designated a 
        UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005.

       With the construction of the railway in 1906 from Lagos, Osogbo became a major collecting 
       point for cocoa and palm oil and kernels produced in the surrounding area. The town’s trade 
       is primarily in yams, cassava (manioc), corn (maize), beans, okra, palm produce, and cotton.
       Food-processing plants and a steel-rolling mill are local industries. Osogbo is the site of
       the Hamzainab College of Education. Next to the oba’s market is the central mosque and the
       town hall. Pop. (2016 est.) urban agglom., 820,000.</p>

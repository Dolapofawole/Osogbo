        <h1>Osun Osogbo festival</h1>

                    Osun-Osogbo is considered as the biggest annual religious event among the Yoruba people. The event attracts 
                    spectators and worshippers from all over the world in the month of August every year.
                     Osun is a goddess of all things feminine; fertility, spirituality, emotions, sensuality, nurture and love. 
                     The festival began approximately 600 years ago. It was started by the founders of the Osogbo community. 
                     The story told is that the founders intended to clear all the trees in the area for settlement. 

                     <br>As soon as they began felling the trees, a spirit from the river-god Osun ordered them away. Immediately the place turned 
                     to be a sacred place of worship for the devotees. Osun – is often represented as a picturesque woman dressed in 
                     white or yellow – boasting a beautiful smile but truly broken-hearted. During the festival, people appease the 
                     goddess daily for two weeks with different performances which include playing the drums, singing, and dancing. 
                     During the singing and dancing, the people show off their costumes.
                    

                     <br>A sacred forest located in the outskirts of Osogbo is believed to be one of the forests where "Orisha", the spirit
                      they believe blesses them, reveals itself. Devotees are led by a virgin maiden called Arugba who is a link between 
                      the community and deity. The virgin maiden leads in all sacrifices offered in the river. The Arugba (virgin maiden) 
                      carries all the sacrifices (flowers, honey, gold etc) of the community and for all those in attendance. The tradition 
                      dictates that these sacrifices be carried in a big calabash. Before all this happens, the worshippers offer a special 
                      prayer in the shrine of a priestess.
                      

                      <br>The Osun-Osogbo Festival is international. It attracts foreigners who see it as a cultural and religious connection.
                       Tourists from Cuba, Yugoslavia and Slovenia form the majority of Orisha devotees. Over the years, foreigners have confessed 
                       openly about the importance of this festival. Across social media and television platforms, most of them have expressed their 
                       gratitude after receiving blessings. When Nigeria was under the British colonies, missionaries tried to wipe out animist beliefs
                        but to no success. During that time, rituals included human sacrifice. This was however wiped out by the authorities.
